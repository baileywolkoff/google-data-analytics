    "### Analysis Task\n",
    "As a Junior Analyst at the fictitious company *Cyclistic*, I have been tasked with dsicovering the differences between \"Casual Riders\" and \"Annual Members\". This is with the goal in mind of converting casual riders to annual members, as they generate more revenue. These findings will be explored in a separate notebook focused on analysis - where the analysis will be done on the output file of this notebook. These goals should be kept in mind during the cleaning process."

It is an archive of the company's transactions, found in zip files, from the year 2013 until the present. Some files are organized by year, quarter, or month - so it must be noted and organized in analysis accordingly. For the purpose of this assignment, I have taken the previous years data (July, 2020 - June, 2021). There are 12 .csv files within the zip folders - one for each month - that must be concated together for analysis. \n",

    "**Note:** Data-privacy issues prohibit the use of personally identifiable information. Therefore it is impossible to connect pass purchase to credit card numbers, for the purpose of determining if the riders live within the Cyclistic service area, or if they have purchased multiple single passes. This may slightly skew data (as it will be unknown if a single person has purchased multiple day passes where they may be more inclined to buy the annual pass), but should not affect analysis too much, as there is such a large data set that we are working with, this number of affected riders will be insignifcant to final analysis.
