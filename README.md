# google-data-analytics
This repository is a place to save my work done on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate capstone project.

I chose the first case study, which focusses on the fiction bike-share company known as *Cyclistic*. My work is split into two workbooks, the first dealing with cleaning of the data,
while the second will deal with Exploratory Data Analysis. 

By the end of the analysis workbook, I will have reccomended actions to be taken by the company, in order to achieve the goal of converting casual riders to annual members.
